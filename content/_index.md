My username is syrno (seer-no) / syrno9 or syrno9000 on some sites, but my real name is Travis. I'm currently a freshman student in California majoring in computer science (so I am a major doofus when it comes to programming). I spend most of my days on my computer being unproductive but sometimes I'll work on homework.
