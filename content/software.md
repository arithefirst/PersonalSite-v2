title: "Software I Use"
---

## Operating System
- I like Artix Linux but I dual boot Tiny10 for stuff I'm not bothered to get running on Linux. (This list primarily focuses on stuff I run on Linux)

## Browser
- Primarily LibreWolf but I also like using modified Firefox.

## Window Manager/Desktop Environment
- I like dwm. It's the only window manager I'm used to since it's pretty much the only one I've ever used. It makes it easy for me to do stuff efficiently. For desktop environments, I used to use Trinity or XFCE a lot but I can't be bothered with DE's anymore on Linux.

## Terminal
- I like st and I use it cause it works well with dwm.

## Text Editor
- Neovim with NVChad. I'm too lazy to make my own neovim config. This one is pretty good for what I need.

## File Manager
- I like PCManFM. I don't want to use a terminal file manager cause I'm lazy.

## Media
- I like mpv for videos and music. I like feh for images.

## IRC Client
- HexChat works well.
